# Dummy React Conf Website

My first ever React project, it is a part of my React learning path, and is acctually an idea I got from the "50 Projects for React and the Static Web Colby Fayock 1.0" Book.

I know that the design is too basic, and I'll be improving it overtime.

Also there is not that much functionalities, so I'll be adding some in the future.

Technology used so far :

- Reactjs (via create-react-app) : as the main framework of development
- React Router (with react-router-dom) : for the routes inside the website
- React Bootstrap (with react-bootstrap) : for the whole design
- faker.js : for dummy information

Website structure :

- Home
    - Schedule
    - Location
    - Food
    - Code of conduct
